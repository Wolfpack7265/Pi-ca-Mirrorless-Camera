# Pi-ca-Mirrorless-Camera
Interchangeable lens mirrorless camera project, using Raspberry pi HQ camera module

#Intro
raspberry pi camera project to produce an open-source, feature-packed camera using the raspberry pi HQ camera module. The idea for this project came from the desire to get a secondary point-and-shoot camera for my daily photography. Instead of buying from the list of overpriced digicams on facebook marketplace, I decided to create something with the features I wanted most!

At the heart of the pi-ca is the raspberry pi HQ module, which utlizes Sony's IMX477 Image sensor. The sensor features the following specs for photos:
- 12.3mp resolution
- stacked, back-side illuminated sensor deisgn
- analog and digital gain adjustments
- 1/2.3 size sensor (7.564 mm H vs. 5.476mm V) = 5.5x crop factor
- electronic shutter with a max shutter speed of about 1/3000s (300 microseconds)
- sensor flipping and mirroring
- ambient light sensor
- 

For video, it gets even better, with a list of features that even compare to cameras released in 2024:
- 1080p @ up to 240fps
- 4k @ 60fps
- Full sensor readout (4056 x 3040) @ up to 60fps
- up to 12 bit RAW output in full sensor format
